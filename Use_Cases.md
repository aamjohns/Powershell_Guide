# Real World use cases for Powershell Scripts

PowerShell scripts have a wide range of real-world use cases, as they can be used to automate and manage various aspects of Windows systems and applications. Some common real-world use cases include:

- System administration tasks: PowerShell scripts can automate repetitive tasks like creating user accounts, managing permissions, resetting passwords, and managing group memberships.

- Monitoring and reporting: You can use PowerShell scripts to collect system performance data, generate reports, and monitor the health of your environment.

- Software deployment and updates: PowerShell scripts can automate the process of deploying software, applying patches, and updating applications on remote machines.

- File and data manipulation: PowerShell scripts can be used to automate file operations like copying, moving, renaming, and deleting files, as well as processing data in text files, CSV files, or XML files.

- Log analysis and event management: PowerShell scripts can be used to parse logs, filter events, and perform actions based on specific events or conditions.

- Network administration: You can use PowerShell scripts to manage network settings, monitor network devices, and perform diagnostics on network connections.

- Backup and recovery: PowerShell scripts can be used to automate backup processes, verify backups, and manage disaster recovery tasks.

- Virtualization and cloud management: PowerShell scripts can be used to manage virtual machines, automate tasks in cloud environments like Azure or AWS, and interact with REST APIs.

- Active Directory management: PowerShell scripts can automate tasks like creating and deleting Organizational Units (OUs), managing Group Policy Objects (GPOs), and querying Active Directory information.

- Exchange and Office 365 management: PowerShell scripts can be used to manage Exchange Server and Office 365 environments, including mailbox creation, mailbox permissions, and email routing.

- SQL Server administration: PowerShell scripts can be used to manage SQL Server instances, automate database backups, and perform database maintenance tasks.

- API access: Powershell script can be use to get and put information from 3rd party APIs.

Here's a script I have written/used to show examples of real world use of scripts.

This script creates a scheduled task on a system that runs once every 4 weeks at 9 am, if the start time is missed, then the task is started as soon as available.
```
#------------------------------------------------------------
# Create new scheduled task to run CIS-Benchmarks
#------------------------------------------------------------
$path_to_script = 'C:\Support\CIS-Benchmark-4_15_2\CIS-Benchmark-4_15_2.ps1'
$action = New-ScheduledTaskAction -Execute 'powershell.exe' -Argument $path_to_script
$trigger = New-ScheduledTaskTrigger -Weekly -WeeksInterval 4 -DaysOfWeek Monday -At 9am
$principal = New-ScheduledTaskPrincipal -UserId "NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM" -LogonType ServiceAccount
$settings = New-ScheduledTaskSettingsSet -StartWhenAvailable #StartWhenAvailable tells the task to run if missed

Register-ScheduledTask -TaskName "CIS-Benchmark_4_15_2" -Action $action -Trigger $trigger -Principal $principal -Settings $settings

exit 0
```
