# Breakpoints

Breakpoints and stepping through code are essential debugging techniques in PowerShell, allowing you to pause script execution and examine variables, script flow, and more. You can use breakpoints and stepping commands in the PowerShell Integrated Scripting Environment (ISE) or Visual Studio Code with the PowerShell extension.

Here's a brief overview of breakpoints and stepping through code in PowerShell:

1. Breakpoints: Breakpoints let you pause the script execution at a specific line or when a condition is met. To set a breakpoint in PowerShell ISE, click on the line number in the script pane or use the keyboard shortcut F9. In Visual Studio Code, click on the left margin of the line number or press F9.

2. Running the script: After setting a breakpoint, run the script in PowerShell ISE with F5 or in Visual Studio Code using F5. The script execution will pause when it reaches the breakpoint.

3. Stepping through code: Once the script execution is paused, you can use the following stepping commands to navigate through the code:

   - Step Over (PowerShell ISE: F10, Visual Studio Code: F10): Executes the current line and moves to the next one. If the current line is a function call, it will execute the entire function without stepping into it.

   - Step Into (PowerShell ISE: F11, Visual Studio Code: F11): Executes the current line and moves to the next one. If the current line is a function call, it will step into the function, allowing you to debug the function line by line.

   - Step Out (PowerShell ISE: Shift + F11, Visual Studio Code: Shift + F11): Executes the remaining lines of the current function and returns to the calling function.

4. Examining variables: While stepping through the code, you can examine the values of variables in the Variables pane (PowerShell ISE) or the Debug sidebar (Visual Studio Code). You can also hover over variables in the script pane to see their current values.

5. Resuming execution: To continue executing the script after pausing at a breakpoint, press F5 in either PowerShell ISE or Visual Studio Code. The script will resume execution and pause again at the next breakpoint, if any.

6. Removing breakpoints: To remove a breakpoint, click on the breakpoint marker in the line number margin or press F9 with the cursor on the breakpoint line.

Debugging with breakpoints and stepping through code can help you identify issues in your PowerShell scripts, understand the script flow, and verify that variables have the expected values during execution.
