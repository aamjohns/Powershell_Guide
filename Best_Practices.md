# Best Practices for scripting

Following best practices for scripting helps ensure that your scripts are maintainable, readable, and efficient. Here are some best practices for PowerShell scripting:

- Use proper indentation and formatting: Proper indentation and formatting make your script easier to read and understand. Use a consistent style throughout your script.

- Comment your code: Add comments to explain what your code is doing. This makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand your code and make modifications when necessary.

- Use meaningful variable and function names: Choose descriptive names for your variables and functions that convey their purpose. This makes your script more readable and maintainable.

- Use the CmdletBinding attribute: Add the [CmdletBinding()] attribute to your functions to enable advanced functionality such as parameter validation and support for common parameters.

- Use the param block to define function parameters: This allows you to use parameter validation attributes and set default values for your parameters.

- Use approved verbs for function names: Use approved PowerShell verbs for your function names to maintain consistency and follow the standard naming convention. You can view a list of approved verbs by running Get-Verb.

- Limit the use of global variables: Use local variables and function parameters to pass data around your script. This reduces the risk of accidentally modifying global variables and makes your script more modular.

- Handle errors properly: Use try, catch, and finally blocks to handle errors and clean up resources. Use the -ErrorAction common parameter to control error handling behavior.

- Modularize your code: Break your script into smaller functions that perform specific tasks. This makes your code more maintainable and easier to debug.

- Test your code: Test your script thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Use tools like Pester for unit testing and validating your script's functionality.

- Use version control: Store your script in a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate with others.

- Keep security in mind: Avoid using plain-text credentials, and instead, use secure methods like Windows Credential Manager, or use the Get-Credential cmdlet. Also, validate user input and sanitize it when necessary to prevent security vulnerabilities.
