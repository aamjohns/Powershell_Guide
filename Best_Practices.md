# Best Practices for scripting

Following best practices for scripting helps ensure that your scripts are maintainable, readable, and efficient. Here are some best practices for PowerShell scripting:

- Use proper indentation and formatting: Proper indentation and formatting make your script easier to read and understand. Use a consistent style throughout your script.

- Use full cmdlet names and avoid aliases in scripts: While aliases can be convenient when working in the console, they can make your script less readable and maintainable. Use full cmdlet names in your scripts to improve clarity.

- Validate user input: Validate user input to ensure it meets specific criteria before processing it in your script. Use parameter validation attributes, like [ValidateNotNull()], [ValidateRange()], and [ValidateScript()], to enforce constraints or conditions on the input data.

- Use single quotes for string literals and double quotes for string interpolation: Use single quotes (' ') for string literals that do not need variable expansion or escape sequences. Use double quotes (" ") when you need to use string interpolation or escape sequences.

- Comment your code: Add comments to explain what your code is doing. This makes it easier for others (and yourself) to understand your code and make modifications when necessary.

- Use meaningful variable and function names: Choose descriptive names for your variables and functions that convey their purpose. This makes your script more readable and maintainable.

- Use the CmdletBinding attribute: Add the [CmdletBinding()] attribute to your functions to enable advanced functionality such as parameter validation and support for common parameters.

- Use the param block to define function parameters: This allows you to use parameter validation attributes and set default values for your parameters.

- Use approved verbs for function names: Use approved PowerShell verbs for your function names to maintain consistency and follow the standard naming convention. You can view a list of approved verbs by running Get-Verb.

- Follow established PowerShell scripting conventions: Adhere to PowerShell scripting conventions such as using PascalCase for cmdlet and function names, and using lowercase with hyphens for parameter names (also known as kebab-case).

- Limit the use of global variables: Use local variables and function parameters to pass data around your script. This reduces the risk of accidentally modifying global variables and makes your script more modular.

- Handle errors properly: Use try, catch, and finally blocks to handle errors and clean up resources. Use the -ErrorAction common parameter to control error handling behavior.

- Modularize your code: Break your script into smaller functions that perform specific tasks. This makes your code more maintainable and easier to debug.

- Write functions that accept pipeline input: Design your functions to accept input from the pipeline by using the ValueFromPipeline and ValueFromPipelineByPropertyName attributes. This makes your functions more flexible and allows them to be used in a more PowerShell-like way.

- Document your functions: Use comment-based help or XML-based help to provide documentation for your functions, including a description, examples, and parameter explanations. This makes it easier for users to understand how to use your functions effectively.

- Test your code: Test your script thoroughly to ensure it works as expected. Use tools like Pester for unit testing and validating your script's functionality.

- Use version control: Store your script in a version control system like Git to track changes and collaborate with others.

- Keep security in mind: Avoid using plain-text credentials, and instead, use secure methods like Windows Credential Manager, or use the Get-Credential cmdlet. Also, validate user input and sanitize it when necessary to prevent security vulnerabilities.
